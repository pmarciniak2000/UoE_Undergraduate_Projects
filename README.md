### UoE_Undergraduate_Projects
A collection of some of the projects I completed in my time studying at the University Of Edinburgh (2018-2023)

# UG2:

 ## **Software Engineering**

This course required implementing a bicycle rental system in Java. The system helps customers to rent the cheapest bicycles and find the nearest bike company to them. The system provides functions such as calculating the rental price, calculating the distance between the customer and the rental company, providing rental renewals, and providing reviews of rental companies.

## **Reasoning and Agents**

Create a planner using the Planning Domain Definition Language(PDDL)

### Coursework Grade: 77% (A3)

## **Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures**

Trialling different heuristics for the travelling salesman problem.
Swap Heuristic - Repeatedly swap order in which adjacent cities visited, if this lowers the cost we keep the order 
2-Opt - Reverse order of a continguous sequence of cities and see if it reduces costs
Greedy - At each point find the next nearest point and hope that it leads to a globally optimal solution
Nearest Insertion - A more advanced form of the greedy search which finds the nearest destination from a sub-tour of cities

### Coursework Grade: 74% (A3)

# UG3:

## **Informatics Large Practical**

This course required implementing a drone that would fly over a geojson stored map and collect items in a specified positions. The drone algorithm had to be optimised such that it would use as little fuel as possible whilst navigating obstacles such as buildings, i.e. no-fly zones.

### Coursework Grade: 78% (A3)

## **Introductory Applied Machine Learning**

Introductory course to machine learning that required using various different machine learning algorithms.

### Overall Coursework Grade: 78% (A3)

## **Computer Security**

CW2 - Performing a man in the middle (MitM attack) oto intercept a chat between Alice and Bob. The attack files are found in eve.py.

CW3 - Writting bash scripts that would perform buffer overflow attacks on provided programs with existing vulnerabilities. If the attack was successful as secret would be printed out to the console.

Note: CW1 was formative and was self contained in wireshark

### Overall Coursework Grade: 100% (A1)

## **Operating Systems**

All the courseworks for this course required implementing features in a mock-up operating system designed by one of the lecturers of the course. The os was InfOS and can be found at https://github.com/tspink/infos

CW1 - Implement a real-time clock by looking into the CMOS register

CW2 - Implement a round robin and FIFO process scheduling algorithm

CW3 - Implement a physical memory allocator baded on the buddy allocation algorithm

CW4 - Implement a file-system driver that can handle TAR files

### Overall Coursework Grade: 88% (A2)

## **Systems Design Project**

Group project with the aim of designing an assistive robot. My team created a fuel pump robot in Webots and designed a Java Android Application to control the robot.

### Coursework Grade: 69% (B)

# UG4:

## **Introduction to Databases**

CW1 - Relational algebra queries

CW2 - SQL queries

### Overall Coursework Grade: 82% (A2)

## **Computer Communication and Networks**

CW1 - Analysing network traffic with python by looking into data packets

CW2 - Creating of 4 sender/receiver UDP packet transfer programs of increasing complexity
      Part1: Basic transfer of large file under ideal conditions
      Part2: Implement a Stop-and-Wair procedure using an ACK message
      Part3: Implement a Go-Back-N that could handle window sizes greater than 1
      Part4: Selective Repeat procedure that will allow and lost packets to be easily retransmitted without having to send the whole message again

CW3 - Applying openflow to aid in packet analysis

### Overall Coursework Grade: 93% (A1)

## **Foundations of Natural Language Processing**

CW1 - NLP text preprocessing, feature extraction and POS tag prediction

CW2 - Training of a Hidden Markoc Model and implementing the Viterbi Algorithm

### Overall Coursework Grade: 81% (A2)

## **Software Testing**

The coursework for this project required writing tests to find hidden bugs in a compiled jar file. We then had to implement additional features into the codebase and write tests for the additional functionality.

### Coursework Grade: 98% (A1)

### CODE FOR THIS YEAR'S PROJECTS WILL ONLY BE PUBLISHED AFTER DEADLINES HAVE PASSED DUE TO UNIVERSITY POLICY

## UG5: 

## **Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers**

CW2 - Contract that allows two players to roll a dice. A commit-reveal scheme was adopted for secure number randomisation.

CW3 - Contract to represent a custom token, with options to let the contract owner mint tokens to addresses and allow users to sell and transfer any tokens they own.

CW4 - Writing a technical specification for an on-chain implementation of the GO game. There is no programming involved in this coursework as the task was to write a specification so that another person could use it to actually implement the game in Solidity.

## **Principles and Design of IoT Systems**

Group project requiring desinging an app to interface witha Respeck motion sensor and then use machine learning algorithms for Human Activity Recogintion.

## **Advanced Database Systems**

Minibase database implementations

## **Computer Graphics**

CW1 - The task was to add synthetic objects with shadows/reflections into a picture we had taken. The picture had to include a brush. This was done by recreating a proxy of the picture we had taken in blender and then adding synthetic objects to the blender scene. We then had to render the scene with PBRT and composite the rendered image with the original one using GIMP to try and create a realistic looking image with our synthetically generated objects.

CW2

## **Text Technologies for Data Science**

CW1 - Individual search engine project that could perform simple boolean queries.

CW2 - IR evaluation of systems and web search.

CW3 - Group search engine project.
