### UoE_Undergraduate_Projects
A collection of the numerous projects I completed in my time studying at the University Of Edinburgh

## UG2:

**Software Engineering**

This course required implementing a bicycle rental system in Java. The system helps customers to rent the cheapest bicycles and find the nearest bike company to them. The system provides functions such as calculating the rental price, calculating the distance between the customer and the rental company, providing rental renewals, and providing reviews of rental companies.

**Reasoning and Agents**

**Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures**

## UG3:

**Informatics Large Practical**

This course required implementing a drone that would fly over a geojson stored map and collect items in a specified positions. The drone algorithm had to be optimised such that it would use as little fuel as possible whilst navigating obstacles such as buildings, i.e. no-fly zones.

**Introductory Applied Machine Learning**

Introductory course to machine learning that required using various different machine learning algorithms.
