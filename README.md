### UoE_Undergraduate_Projects
A collection of some of the projects I completed in my time studying at the University Of Edinburgh (2018-2023)

## UG2:

**Software Engineering**

This course required implementing a bicycle rental system in Java. The system helps customers to rent the cheapest bicycles and find the nearest bike company to them. The system provides functions such as calculating the rental price, calculating the distance between the customer and the rental company, providing rental renewals, and providing reviews of rental companies.

**Reasoning and Agents**

Planning Coursework

**Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures**

Travelling Salesman Problem

## UG3:

**Informatics Large Practical**

This course required implementing a drone that would fly over a geojson stored map and collect items in a specified positions. The drone algorithm had to be optimised such that it would use as little fuel as possible whilst navigating obstacles such as buildings, i.e. no-fly zones.

**Introductory Applied Machine Learning**

Introductory course to machine learning that required using various different machine learning algorithms.

**Computer Security**

CW2 - MITM

CW3 - Writting bash scripts that would perform buffer overflow attacks on provided programs with existing vulnerabilities. If the attack was successful as secret would be printed out to the console.

Note: CW1 was formative and was self contained in wireshark

**Operating Systems**

CW1

CW2

CW3

**Systems Design Project**

Group project with the aim of designing an assistive robot. My team created a fuel pump robot in Webots and designed a Java Android Application to control the robot.

## UG4:

**Introduction to Databases**

CW1 - Relational algebra queries

CW2 - SQL queries

**Computer Communication and Networks**

CW1

CW1

CW1

**Foundations of Natural Language Processing**

CW1

CW2

**Software Testing**

The coursework for this project required writing tests to find hidden bugs in a compiled jar file. We then had to implement additional features into the codebase and write tests for the additional functionality.

## UG5:

**Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers**

CW1

CW2

CW3

CW4

**Principles and Design of IoT Systems**

Group project requiring desinging an app to interface witha Respeck motion sensor and then use machine learning algorithms for Human Activity Recogintion.

**Advanced Database Systems**

**Computer Graphics**

CW1

CW2

**Text Technologies for Data Science**
